**An open source Phase-Diffusion Quantum Random Number Generator**

## Randomness from Vacuum Fluctuations

When a laser diode powers up, there are quantum fluctuations that occur that later determine the laser's current polarization during operation. This means that if we pulse a laser diode on, then off long enough to let it totally power down, and then repeat, each pulse has unique and 'quantum random'-ly determined properties. 

We can send these pulses into an optical fiber network, and split the pulse so that ~50% goes to the detector, and the rest gets sent to a delay line - here, we use 5m length of fiber as our photonic delay line. 5m is long enough that with the timing of our pulses (roughly every 24ns) the pulse travelling over the delay loop will interact with the next pulse from the laser diode. 

The fact that each of these are different, and randomly so, means that their interactions are fundamentally chaotic and random. This is great, for a QRNG - and so this is what we estimate and measure. You can see examples of the pulses below. 

Details maybe found in the paper [Ultra-fast quantum randomness generation by accelerated phase diffusion in a pulsed laser diode](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-22-2-1645) by Abellán et al.

### Software Overview

There are three parts to this system; the PIO program, the ADC acquisition code, and the min-entropy calculation and hashing code communicating over UART over USB.

The Pi Pico is overclocked to its maximum speed of 250MHz. This gives us 125MHz maximum pulse frequency, However, given the laser diode has to completely desaturate between pulses in order for the vacuum fluctuations to be utilized, we pulse once for 4ns, then rest for 20ns. Whilst this ends up requiring a longer delay line, it amplifies the effect we are trying to utilize by guaranteeing desaturation of the emitter. 

The PIO code sets is as follows:

```c
.wrap_target
    set pins, 1 
    set pins, 0 [4]
.wrap
```

The code on core 0 is the ADC acquisition code. It reads the signal that is biased at 1.65V, exactly in the center of the Pico's 3.3V ADC range. The ADC is 12-bit, meaning our readings are centered around the value 2048, with a maximum of 4096. The ADC measurements are collected in window arrays of length 1024 `int` values, and passed through a blocking write to an array owned by core 1. 

Core 1 runs the min-entropy calculation code and manages UART communications. It performs an optimized min-entropy calculation that performs a lagged look-around analysis to generate a histogram of delta difference values for each of the measurements. This normalizes the calculation from being 'peak heavy' from the pulsed nature of the randomness, and attempts to avoid any incidental features from the 500kHz max speed of the Pico's ADC. Given we are using a window of 1024 (2^10) samples, the maximum value for min-entropy is 10. The min-entropy calculation code is as follows:

```c
for(int i = 0; i < BATCH_SIZE; i++) {
    // Mask to ensure we only look at 12 bits
    uint16_t val = batch.samples[i] & 0xFFF;
    
    // --- Update Min/Max (Raw Data) ---
    if (val < min_val) min_val = val;
    if (val > max_val) max_val = val;
    // ---------------------------

    // --- LAGGED DERIVATIVE CALCULATION ---
    // 1. Get the "Old" value from history
    uint16_t old_val = history[hist_head];
    
    // 2. Overwrite history with current value
    history[hist_head] = val;
    
    // 3. Advance the ring buffer head
    hist_head = (hist_head + 1) % LAG_DEPTH;

    // 4. Calculate Delta against the OLD value
    // We add 2048 to center the result.
    uint16_t delta = (val - old_val + 2048) & 0xFFF;
    // -------------------------------------

    // Update Histogram using DELTA
    if(counts[delta] < 65535) counts[delta]++; 
    if(counts[delta] > max_count) {
        max_count = counts[delta];
    }
}

// Calculate Min-Entropy
float min_entropy = 10.0f - log2f((float)max_count);

// Calculate Range
uint16_t dynamic_range = max_val - min_val;
```

## Hardware

### Bill of Materials

**Optics:**

* 2x fiber splitters - 1x2 or 2x2
* 1x Delay line (5 meters)
* Optical connectors

For our assembly, we use SC/APC fiber connectors. These are square with angled ends that minimize reflections at any interfaces. 

**Electronics:**

* 1x Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico 2)
* 1x Prototype Board
* 1x pair of fiber optic transceivers
* 1x 10nF ceramic capacitor
* 2x 10k Ohm resistors (through hole)
* 1x prototyping board
* Assorted connection wires

Many optical transcievers transmit/receive on 1310/1550nm or tx/rx at 1550/1310nm. (1310nm is in O-band and 1550nm is in C-band in conventional fiber optic parlance). 

### Prototype Board Assembly

The following summarises the pin assignments for the Pico:

* `GPIO0` is used as the laser driver. A PIO program is run to offload this from the CPI.
* `ADC0` is used to read the data from the receiver, running on core 0
* The USB port is used to analyse and generate the final randomness and min-entropy outputs, and is controlled from core 1. 

### Optical Assembly

This is a sketch overview of the RPi pico driver, laser/PD and splitter setup. The Delay Loop used below is 5m in length.

![](images/PD-QRNG.drawio.svg)

This is what the system looks like in hardware:

![PD-QRNG-v1](images/pd-qrng-v1.jpg)

### Circuit Details

`GPIO0` and `ADC0` are used on the RPi Pico. Here are more details:

* The `3V3` and `GND` pins (3rd and 5th on RHS) are used to power the two fiber modules.
* Both an A and a B module are used - one transmits at 1310 and receives at 1510, the other at 1510 and receives at 1310.
* Pin 8 on the A module (`TX` positive pin) is used to drive the laser.
* Pin 2 on the B module (`RX` positive pin) is used to receive.
* Between this `RX` pin and the `ADC0` pin, there is a small circuit that normalizes the voltage from being centered around 0V to being centered around 1.65V. This circuit is comprised of:
    * 2x 10k Ohm resistors are used. On is connected to `3V3` and the other to `GND` they form a voltage divider the middle of which is tied to `ADC0`.
    * 1x 10nF ceramic capacitor is used - this goes from `RX` to `ADC0` that has the voltage lift from the divider. 

The circuit schematic for the output level shifter looks like this: 

![Circuit Diag](images/circuit.svg)

### Note on Fiber Choices

For our build, we use SC/APC fiber connector parts - these are usually green in colour. SC Connectors are very easy to use and reconfigure, hence they were chosen. Blue SC connectors are UPC, meaning they have flat ends which can cause reflections of signal. SC/APC connectors have an 8 degree angle cut on the end to minimize reflections, which is ideal for our purposes. Yellow fiber cabling is usually patch fiber, which is what we want to use. We use multimode 9/125 fiber in this build - that is 125um diameter with a 9um core. 

The transcievers we use are usually multimode - that is they have one side that transmits on 1310nm and receives on 1510nm frequencies, and the other side receives on 1310nm and transmits on 1510nm light frequencies. We use 1310nm for Tx/Rx, but the choice of which frequency to use is inconsequential.

## Full Build

### Transiever Pinout

The pinout for each transceiver unit is as follows. Pin 1 is the left-most pin when looking down on the top of the device with the fiber pointing away from you. The pinout is as follows:

![pinout](images/transceiver-pinout.avif)

We will just use the `RD+` and `TD+` pins for Rx/Tx respectively. Note that you have to supply +3.3V to EITHER the `VCCR` on the Rx side and `VCCT` on the Tx side, as they have separate power supplies.

### Build Overview

The Pi Pico uses `ADC0` for Rx and `GPIO0` for Tx - with the 3.3V supply and GND pins powering the units. The overall wiring looks like this from below:

![wiring1](images/20260203_150119-EDIT.jpg)

Here is the top view - you can see how the voltage divider and ceramic capacitor:

![wiring2](images/20260205_091957~2.jpg)

The capacitor is tied to one side on pin 2 of the receive module, and the other side is tied to the joint between the two resistors in the voltage divider. The push pull of the Rx signal is thereby inverted over the capacitor and shifted to 1.65V, which is the precise middle of the 3.3V `ADC0` range. 

### Fiber Build

The fiber is built exactly as photographed above. The setup is symmetrical, so there is no specified in/out or tx/rx port. The two free ports go to either module.

Remember, the fiber network is essentially an amplifier for the quantum vacuum fluctuations in the laser diode startup.

## Results 

The following show some measurement results off a six metre fiber delay loop in a MZI configuration, with a 38MHz base pulse step with 4 sleep steps following. 

This is the base pulse from the PIO program on `GPIO0`:

![Trigger Pulse](oscope-pics/SDS00145.png)

Here is the base pulse sent over a 1.5m loop of fiber - 

![base pulse](oscope-pics/SDS00147.png)

And here is the full output from the `RX` pin sent to the ADC over the interferometry network:

![final mixed result](oscope-pics/SDS00130.png)

Here are two zoomed in portions to help show the randomness of the system:

![zoomed in 20us](oscope-pics/SDS00140.png)
![soomed in 200ns](oscope-pics/SDS00153.png)
<!-- ![zoomed in 100ns](oscope-pics/SDS00129.png)
![zoomed in 100ns v2](oscope-pics/SDS00128.png) -->

This is a much zoomed in signal from the receiver:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00152.png)

## But How do we Know It's Quantum?

Suppose we take our transciever setup, and run the Pico as normal. Then let's hook it up to the two splitters. If we just connect one of the fibers between the two, we get the following output trace:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00162.png)

However, if we add both fibers, we get the following trace:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00161.png)

The fact that these are so similar is encouraging, as it means that the two signals are either matching, cancelling out, or adding some more noise from the few extra lengths of fiber.

The following is the output when you add the delay line back between one of the connections between the splitters - the dramatic change in the signal despite the same oscilloscope settings means that we are surely seeing some kind of quantum interference resulting from the vacuum fluctuations in the laser diode startup:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00163.png)

We can look at some zoomed-in versions to see the difference. Here is the signal with one connection between the splitters:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00155.png)

Here is the signal zoomed-in with two arms connected - we can see that the signal is in part amplified and in others slightly variable:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00156.png)

With the delay line included, we can see the randomness in the signal from the interference of the non-matching laser pulses:

![](oscope-pics/SDS00157.png)

### Comparison of PIO Signal to Output

Here is the base signal with the base pulse in purple:

![base1](oscope-pics/SDS00168.png)

Here is the baseline random signal from the interference with the baseline signal in purple again:

![base1](oscope-pics/SDS00167.png)

Note that there is a 'peak-y-ness' in the signal that correlates with the baseline somewhat. This is why we use jittered readings to avoid falling into traps around that potential correlation. 

## Entropy Tests

### Running `ent`

On a file with 256 million raw bytes converted from the input, the following result was obtained from running the `ent` entropy test suite, a standard tool in Linux:

```bash
user@qrng:~$ ls -l qrng_dump.bin 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 256000000 Feb  4 14:28 qrng_dump.bin
user@qrng:~$ ent -b ./qrng_dump.bin 
Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 2048000000 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 2048000000 samples is 0.15, and randomly
would exceed this value 69.96 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.5000 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141611487 (error 0.00 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000025 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
user@qrng:~$ 
```

Things of note - Entropy of "around 1 bit per bit" is ideal. Chi-squared values need to be between 0.05 and 0.95, so 0.65 is pretty reasonable. Serial correlation less than 0.00005 is usually considered pretty good, too. 

Calculating >2 digits of pi with randomness is pretty hard - this is for the same reason that `22/7` is such an unreasonably good approximation of pi; the continued fraction of pi has a very large term (292) in it's fourth coefficient (`[3;7,15,1,292...]`). This means that getting `3.1416` vs `3.1415...` (0.0001 off) on a reasonably small dataset is encouraging. 

On this test suite, the randomness is performing pretty well, it seems!

## Sample Serial Output

Here is some example output from the UART connection. `H_min` is the output of the min-entropy calculation. When scaled to 8 bits, ~6-6.4 is considered generally good. `R` is the range, and `Data` precedes two lines of `SHA512` hashes that are the condensed versions of the input entropy pools:
